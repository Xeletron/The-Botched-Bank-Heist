heist_jambank_name: "The Botched Bank Heist"
heist_jambank_briefing: "The Colicopia Coin Cache is one of the most sought after collectors items in the world, and I simply must have them. They are in the process of being transferred over to a museum, but due to a scheduling conflict they will be sitting idle in a small bank for a few days. This is where you come in. My driver will take you to the bank, where you storm in and find the vault before people realize what's happening. I've asked around in a few chatrooms and learnt that with thermite you can burn open the vault door no problem. After it's open, you should be able to take the coins and zipline them across the river to my boat. Once you got enough I've arranged some diving equipment for you to make your escape with.\nA simple but bulletproof plan, right?"
heist_jambank_crimenet: "A private collector would like your help in hitting a bank for a large shipment of millennia old coins. He says he has a rock solid plan and should be a straight forward job.\n\n»Locate the vault\n»Use thermite to open the vault\n»Steal the coins\n»Escape via the river"

# - OBJECTIVES
hud_heist_jambank1_hl: "Investigate the Vault"
hud_heist_jambank1: "The cops were expecting you and caused a big ruckus. The vault is surely secured by now, go and check out how."
hud_heist_jambank2_hl: "Get into the managers office"
hud_heist_jambank2: "The way to the vault is locked by a security gate, only the bank manager has the code. Find him in the upstairs office."
hud_heist_jambank3_hl: "Escort the manager to the time lock"
hud_heist_jambank3: "Get the manager to the time lock so he can enter the code. Make sure he doesn't run away."
hud_heist_jambank4_hl: "Get the correct code and start the time lock"
hud_heist_jambank4: "Shout at the manager until he enters the correct code to start the timelock. You might also need a keycard for the keypad."
hud_heist_jambank5_hl: "Wait for the time lock"
hud_heist_jambank5: "Wait for the timelock to open the security gate. Don't let the cops stop it"
hud_heist_jambank6_hl: "Unpause the time lock"
hud_heist_jambank6: "The timelock has been stopped. Use the keypad to start it again."
hud_heist_jambank7_hl: "Find the security box and cut the correct wires"
hud_heist_jambank7: "Security measures have disabled the timelock. One side of the keypad has lit up, check the wires are connected to that side, then find a security box and cut those same wires in order. The box is somewhere on the first floor."
hud_heist_jambank8_hl: "Go outside and wait for the driver"
hud_heist_jambank8: "The thermite you need was left in the trunk of the car. Get out on the road and wait for the driver to bring it you."
hud_heist_jambank9_hl: "Take the thermite and use it on the vault"
hud_heist_jambank9: "The driver made his last delivery, take the thermite from the trunk and use it on the vault to burn off the handle"
hud_heist_jambank10_hl: "Wait for the thermite to burn through"
hud_heist_jambank10: "Wait until the thermite finished burning through the vault door handle. In the meantime, perhaps you could find a way to open the shutters to the deposit boxes. Maybe a laptop could open them."
hud_heist_jambank11_hl: "Use the thermite on the vault"
hud_heist_jambank11: "Burn the vault handle off with the thermite you definetly have on you."
hud_heist_jambank12_hl: "Drill the vault"
hud_heist_jambank12: "The thermite didn't fully open the vault, use a drill to open the remaining security measures."
hud_heist_jambank13_hl: "Open the vault"
hud_heist_jambank13: "The vault has no more security measures, time to open it."
hud_heist_jambank14_hl: "Steal and secure the coins"

clt_jambank_end_01:  "Well we sure had some hickups along the way, but it went pretty well dont you think? Enjoy your payment fellas, and pour one out for old Mick."
clt_jambank_intro_01: "We're almost there, bank's just around the corner."
clt_jambank_intro_02: "What the? A police blockade, they were expecting us."
clt_jambank_intro_03: "Alright guys we're here. Get out, quick!"

clt_jambank_01_1: "What the hell? How did the cops know about our plan? Well, can't turn back now, check the vault and see if the alarm activated any security measures."
clt_jambank_02_1: "Aw crap, a security gate! The manager outta know where the code is to open it though. His office should be upstairs, so get up there and find him."
clt_jambank_03_1: "Oh come on, get that door open."
clt_jambank_04_1: "Who could have tipped them off? I had thought of everything."
clt_jambank_04_2: "This was supposed to be an easy hit, I had planned it all out, what went wrong?"
clt_jambank_05_1: "Wait where is he? Uh, he must be hiding around the office somewhere. Those closets look like they could fit a person."
clt_jambank_05_2: "Look inside the closets, I'm absolutely positive the manager is hiding in one of them."
clt_jambank_05_3: "Hey, the manager's not going to find himself, check those closets!"
clt_jambank_06_1: "There you go, I knew he'd still be there. Get him down to the keypad, and make sure he doesn't try anything funny."
clt_jambank_07_1: "He's getting away! Get him!"
clt_jambank_07_2: "Hey, don't let him get away!"
clt_jambank_07_3: "Look out, Mr. manager is booking it!"
clt_jambank_08_1: "Convince him to enter the code, a little verbal motivation should do it."
clt_jambank_09_1: "It needs a keycard, of course it does. Try looking around the bank area or offices for one."
clt_jambank_10_1: "Wrong code, keep shouting at him."
clt_jambank_10_2: "Is he trying to be funny? Try motivating him again."
clt_jambank_10_3: "Gave us the wrong code, keep cracking him."
clt_jambank_11_1: "Alight, good. There's still a timelock, but we can get back to the plan after that. Do your plans always end up like this."
clt_jambank_12_1: "Hold on, were those chatrooms public? Oh they had me tracked the entire damn time."
clt_jambank_12_2: "Okay, I might have asked around for vault cracking techniques on, slightly, monitored forums... Oops."
clt_jambank_13_1: "What now? A security lockdown, are you serious? Can you check on the keypad for me?"
clt_jambank_14_1: "Ah, see those wires connected the lit side of the keypad? They're hooked up to a security box somewhere on this floor. If you find it and cut the same colored wires in the same order, it will lift the lockdown."
clt_jambank_15_1: "To lift the security lockdown, check which side of the keypad is lit up and remember the wires connected to it. Then find a security box and cut those same wires in the same order."
clt_jambank_16_1: "Oh you are great, security lockdown disabled. Now go and restart the timelock."
clt_jambank_17_1: "Something wasn't quite right about those wires... But the lockdown has been lifted and nothing seems to have happened. Restart the timelock and maybe it'll be fine."
clt_jambank_18_1: "Finally, we're in. Now, put the thermite on the vault door."
clt_jambank_19_1: "Uhm, you did bring the thermite right?"
clt_jambank_20_1: "You can't be serious."
clt_jambank_21_1: "Mick? Mick! Shit! Okay get the thermite and place it on the vault door. The thermite should cut through the vault like a warm knife through butter."
clt_jambank_22_1: "Good, shouldn't take long for it to burn through. In the meantime try opening those deposit boxes. Anything you find in those are yours to keep."
clt_jambank_23_1: "Did the uh.... did the door handle just fall off without opening the vault? It must have burned through enough internals right? Put a drill on it, that should finish the job. Yea-yeah..."
clt_jambank_24_1: "The drill is done, y'think you could cross your fingers before you open the vault?"
clt_jambank_25_1: "It opened? I mean, of course it did, just as planned. And the coins are there! Fabulous."
clt_jambank_26_1: "You can set up a zipline to secure all the loot. My boat is already on the scene."
clt_jambank_27_1: "Hey that laptop can remotely open the deposit box shutters if your bring it near them, good find."
clt_jambank_29_1: "Did you know some of these coins depict an infamously unlucky king? They say anyone he got in contact with was struck with bad fortune, which if I come to think of it..."
clt_jambank_30_1: "Amazing, that's all I require from you. I strongly advise you take all the coins, but if you really wish to go, head down to the river for your arranged extraction."
clt_jambank_31_1: "Uh oh, that turret must be the result of cutting the wrong wires. Don't get on the wrong end of that thing!"
clt_jambank_32_1: "Ack, they paused the timelock, get it restarted."
clt_jambank_32_2: "Why is the timelock not ticking? Come on guys, restart it already."
clt_jambank_32_3: "Oh you little... restart the timelock, and 'find' whoever stopped it."
clt_jambank_33_1: "Is that a news chopper? We'll be famous! Oh wait, that's bad."
clt_jambank_34_1: "Ooo la la! That coin has markings of the old god Kitteh-Rah on it. You're getting a bonus for that."

drv_jambank_01: "I think it's still in the car."
drv_jambank_02: "I'm coming back, meet me on the road outside."
drv_jambank_03: "Be there in about um... 10 seconds! There's a lot of heat around, so you got to be quick."
drv_jambank_04: "Incoming, I'm going to stop at the end of the road."
drv_jambank_05: "Oh shit..."
